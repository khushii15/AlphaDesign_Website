Various front-end and back-end technologies are available in this era  of digitalization. The technologies used in this project are discussed briefly in the following sections.
1. HTML: (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser.
2. CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
3. JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is a high level, interpreted programming language. JavaScript has curly- bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web (Flanagan, 2006). JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it. JavaScript provides the facility to validate the form on the client-side so data processing will be faster than server-side validation
d)BootStrap
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

To use bootstrap, we are required to either install in our system or use CDN. CDN is short for content delivery network. A CDN is a system of distributes servers that deliver pages and other web content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the
webpage and the content delivery server

2.Back End Technology PHP
We use PHP as a back end language. PHP is an open-source, interpreted, and object-oriented scripting language that can be executed at the server-side. PHP is well suited for web development. Therefore, it is used to develop web applications (an application that executes on the server and generates the dynamic page.).
